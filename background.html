                    The creator of this website is a jock and stud called James Brennen, A.K.A., me.<br>
                    <br>I was born on 23rd of April 2009. That's actually Shakespeare's birthday's month 
                    and day! When I found that out I was like "Oh my god, I'm gonna die at 63 on my <strong> 
                    BIRTHDAY?</strong>". But, you know, I hope that I <i>don't</i> die then, but I mean 
                    still, you know, whatever happens, happens, am I right? I am. I always am. Don't try me.
                    <br><br>Hu, hum, anyway, your most likely here to learn of my mastery in the art of 
                    programming. To be fair I am pretty good. I know multiple languages, such as HTML, 
                    CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C++. I know quite a bit for my age, as some have 
                    told me.
